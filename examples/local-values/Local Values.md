What They Are: Local values serve as a convenient way to assign names to intermediate values, helping to simplify complex expressions and making your configuration easier to read and maintain.

Syntax:

```
locals {
  local_name = expression
}

```

# local_name: The identifier you assign to the value.
# expression: Any valid Terraform expression that computes the value.


## Use Case Example:
Local values are useful when a single value or result from a complex expression is used in multiple places throughout your Terraform configuration. It avoids repetition and keeps the configuration DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Terraform Example:

```
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Owner       = "Network Team"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = merge(
    {
      Name = "MainVPC-${var.environment}"
    },
    local.common_tags
  )
}

```

Here, local values are used to define a common set of tags that are applied to all resources. This ensures consistency across tags and reduces the likelihood of errors.
